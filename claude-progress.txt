## COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION

### Bug Fix: AI Recommendations Light Mode Styling
During regression testing, discovered another light mode visibility issue:

**Issues Found:**
1. "AI Recommendations" section heading - nearly invisible in light mode
2. Recommendation card titles (e.g., "High Failure Rate Detected", "Pending Items Queue") - white text on light background

**Fixes Applied in AIRecommendationCard.jsx:**
1. Changed recommendation title from `text-white` to `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
2. Changed section heading from `text-white` to `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`

**Verification:**
- Tested both light and dark modes
- Screenshots captured showing proper contrast in both themes
- All text now readable in both modes

### Regression Tests Verified:
- Feature #149: Errors clear when fixed ✅ (registration form validation working)
- Dashboard functionality working correctly
- Theme toggle working correctly
- Login/Logout working correctly
