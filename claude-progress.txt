## COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION

### Bug Fix: Light Mode Styling
During regression testing of feature #115 (Light mode styling correct), discovered and fixed visual issues:

**Issues Found:**
1. Quick Stats section - Labels (Pending, Running, etc.) were invisible in light mode
2. Table header - Column headers had poor contrast in light mode
3. Form inputs/dropdowns - Filter controls had dark backgrounds in light mode

**Fixes Applied in Dashboard.jsx:**
1. Updated Quick Stats section with `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-dark-700/50` backgrounds
2. Updated stat labels with `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400` for proper contrast
3. Fixed table header with `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-dark-700/50`
4. Updated column headers with `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`
5. Fixed filter dropdowns and search input with proper light/dark mode styles

**Verification:**
- Tested both light and dark modes
- Screenshots captured in `.playwright-mcp/` directory
- All visual elements now have proper contrast in both themes

### Regression Tests Verified:
- Feature #57: Empty state when no data matches filter ✅
- Feature #115: Light mode styling correct ✅ (after fix)
