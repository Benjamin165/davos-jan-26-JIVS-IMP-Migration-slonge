### Bug Fix
1. **Login Redirect Fix** - Fixed regression in feature #48

   - Verified: Navigate to /settings -> redirect to login -> login -> redirects to /settings correctly

### Features Status

## REMAINING FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

Only 1 feature remaining:
- **#154: GitHub connection** - Currently in progress

All other features (153/154) are passing!

---

## KEY FIXES THIS SESSION

### 1. Login Redirect to Intended Destination (App.jsx, Login.jsx)
- Added `useLocation` import to App.jsx
- ProtectedRoute now passes `state={{ from: location.pathname + location.search }}`
- Login.jsx reads `location.state?.from` and redirects there after login
- Falls back to '/dashboard' if no intended destination

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Complete GitHub push (feature #154)
2. Mark feature #154 as passing after successful push
3. Celebrate 100% completion!

### Application Status

- 153 features verified and passing
